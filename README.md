Welcome to my repository for the HackBio Internship 2024, a collaborative and immersive experience aimed at advancing bioinformatics skills through projects using real-world data.

## About HackBio

HackBio is a bioinformatics internship founded to bridge the gap between knowledge and application in the field of computational biology. With a strong focus on mentorship, collaboration, and hands-on learning, HackBio provided us, aspiring scientists and bioinformaticians, the opportunity to work on significant projects with real-life implications. 

## Track: AMR in Cancer

For this project, my teammates and I were working on the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) in Cancer track. 

Antimicrobial resistance roughly refers to the ability of microbes (*such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites*) to evolve and resist the effects of drugs that were once effective against them. This phenomenon is challenging in cancer treatment, particularly for immunocompromised patients undergoing chemotherapy, where infections caused by resistant pathogens can lead to complications.  

## Tools and Software Used

Throughout the internship, Iâ€™ve been using Python, R and Bash.
