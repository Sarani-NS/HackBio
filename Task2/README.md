# AMR Products Dataset Analysis

This repository contains the analysis and visualization of the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Products dataset, focusing on data cleaning, preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization.

## Project Files

- **WHO_AMR_PRODUCTS_DATA.tsv**: The original AMR dataset.
- **cleaned_data_new.tsv**: Cleaned and preprocessed dataset.
- **preprocessing.py**: Python script for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **preprocessingR.R**: R script for data cleaning and preprocessing (used initially).
- **visualization.py**: Python script for data visualization.
- **Stage2_Task_AMR.md**: Comprehensive report detailing the analysis.

## Steps in the Analysis

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Loaded the dataset into R and Python.
- Checked for missing values and inconsistencies.
- Handled duplicate rows and standardized values.
- Corrected data types (e.g., dates).

### 3. Statistical Analysis
- Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed to identify patterns and correlations.

### 4. Visualization
- Visualized trends, geographic clusters, and AMR product development using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Created interactive charts, heatmaps, bar/line charts, and bubble/scatter plots.

### Reporting and Presentation
- Generated a report summarizing the findings, including charts and insights.
- Prepared a presentation for stakeholders, emphasizing key visualizations and trends.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the preprocessing and visualization scripts
