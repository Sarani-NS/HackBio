# To update

**1. Download the AMR Products Dataset**
Go to this link.
Download the dataset by right-clicking and choosing "Save As" (make sure it's saved as a .tsv file). ✅

**2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
Load the dataset: Import it into your chosen tool (e.g., Python with Pandas, R, Excel). ✅ (done on R on my side)

Clean the data: Check for missing values, duplicate rows, or inconsistencies. ✅
There are NAs, written in 2 different ways so detected differently I guess (N\A and NA). Duplicate rows were handled. Didn't see inconsistencies but doesn't mean there aren't any.

Handle missing data by either filling in values or removing those records.

Ensure that the data types for each column are correct (e.g., dates as datetime, numeric values for counts, etc.).

**3. Statistical Analysis:**
Perform basic descriptive statistics (e.g., counts, averages).
Use inferential statistics to identify significant patterns or correlations.

**4. Innovative Visualization**
Select Visualization Tools: Use tools like Matplotlib/Seaborn (Python), ggplot2 (R), Tableau, Power BI, or Excel.

Design Visualizations:
Interactive Charts: Create dynamic dashboards for real-time analysis, showing trends over time, regions most affected, or the trial phases of different products.
Heatmaps: Highlight regions with the highest severity of antimicrobial resistance.
Bar/Line charts: Show the trends of AMR product development by phase, pathogen, or region.
Bubble Charts/Scatter Plots: Use these to visualize the relationships between trial phases and geographic regions or to show the impact of certain products.

Cholera Outbreak Focus: Given cholera is mentioned, create specific visualizations that show how AMR products might be related to managing cholera outbreaks.

**5. Key Insights**
Identify Key Trends:
Which pathogens have the most products in the pipeline?
Are there geographical clusters of AMR development?
Which drug classes are most promising?

Significant Products:
Highlight products with potential for high impact, particularly those in late-phase trials or with wide coverage against resistant pathogens.

**6. Infographic Design**
Tools: Canva, Adobe Illustrator, or PowerPoint.

Content:
Summarize the key insights (e.g., major pathogens, drugs in development, regions most affected).

Visualize data through charts, icons, and maps.

Focus on conveying complex insights in a simple, accessible way.

**7. Reporting**
Compile Findings: Write a comprehensive report with sections for introduction, methodology, analysis, visualizations, and conclusions.

Executive Summary: Include a clear summary for non-technical audiences.

**8. Presentation**
Prepare a brief presentation to communicate your findings, using the infographic and visualizations as key highlights.
